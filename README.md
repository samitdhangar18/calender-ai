Here is a 349-character project description (GitHub ready):  This project builds a Calendar AI Agent using n8n that accepts chat-based natural language commands to schedule events. It parses user input to extract date, time, and event details, integrates with Google Calendar to block time slots, and sends booking back to the user through chat.
